## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

The game unfolds on an `n×n` forest grid (8–15 tiles).  
You control **LRRH** using movement and rotation commands, exploring the forest one step at a time.

She can:
- **Move forward** to traverse the grid  
- **Rotate clockwise** to change direction  
- **Sense** what lies ahead — *a breeze (pit), a howl (wolf), a scent (flower), heat (bakeshop), sound (woodsman), or light (Granny’s house)*  

**Objective:**  
Reach Granny’s house safely **with both bread and flowers**, and **with the Woodsman’s help**.
