This is to certify that this project is my own work, based on my personal
efforts in studying and applying the concepts learned. I have constructed the
functions and their respective algorithms and corresponding code by myself.
The program was run, tested, and debugged by my own efforts. I further

/*
 * TODO:
 *      Ask Ms. Azcaraga:
 *          - Is the bonus ONLY applicable to the algorithm of LRRH?
 *              - If not, will bonus points be given to advanced concepts used?
 *          
 *          - For test scripts, it was stated that there is no need to creat test
 *            scripts for functions that only perform displaying on screen. Does
 *            this apply for function that asks for inputs as well?
 *          
 *          - For void functions, are test required?
 *          
 *          - Is it strict to have the variables declared? Why?
 *              - If so, this goes the same for loops?
 * 
 *          - Where's the criteria / rubrics?
 *          
 *          - Do we strictly need to follow the comment?
